                <p class="l-txt" style="margin-top:0px;">Compliance means that, as an organization and as individual employees, we follow the rules that govern the Hospital and how it does business. It means following federal, state, and local laws, as well as Hospital policies and procedures.</p>
                <p class="l-txt">These rules are for things such as, Hospital billing for the services it provides to patients; interacting with patients and their families; conducting relationships with our suppliers; and following the legal requirements of the agencies that license the Hospital.</p>

It is important to avoid the perception that a CHOP workforce member could be influenced by free gifts from current or potential vendors.  Our vendor policies are available on our Compliance intranet site. If you have additional questions, talk to your supervisor or the Office of Compliance and Privacy for guidance.</p>

                    <p>Let’s take a look at some scenarios when potential violations may occur.</p>
                    <div class="col-100 l-col section-pad">
                        <h5>Scenario 1: Patient Privacy</h5>
                        <p class="sc1-wrap"><img class="shadow" src="img/cac02/sc1-image.jpg" alt="Woman working at computer with pen and medical documents in hand"/></p>
                        <p>You have access to patient records as part of your job at CHOP. You heard a rumor that one of your neighbors was injured at your neighborhood playground and admitted to the Hospital.  Even though you are not involved in your neighbor’s care, you are tempted to access the medical record in EPIC just to see if he is okay.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong>What should you do?</strong><br/><br/>You should not access the patient record. At CHOP, we are committed to patient privacy, and no member of our workforce should ever access information about a patient or a patient’s family when it is for a purpose unrelated to performing your job at CHOP. Even if your intentions are good, it is still not appropriate to access a patient record for a non-work related purpose, including the location of a patient.  You must contact the information desk for that information, just like any other visitor. </p>

                    <h5>Scenario 2: Billing</h5>
                    <p>You recently joined one of CHOP’s primary care network practices and are reviewing the records of patients that you will be taking over from Dr. Magneto.  You notice in several of the records that Dr. Magneto has billed Medicaid for multiple MRIs and x-rays for patients with ailments that do not seem to require them.  You do not see any documentation in the record to support these orders, nor can you find any images or radiology reports.  You suspect that Dr. Magneto is billing for services that were never performed and you know that it is a physician’s responsibility to only bill for items and services in accordance with the law.</p>

                    <p class="col-35 l-col"><strong>What should you do?</strong><br/><br/>You should raise this concern with CHOP’s Chief Compliance Officer. You learned about the <strong>False Claims Act</strong> and are concerned that CHOP may suffer damages and reputational harm if Dr. Magneto bills for medically unnecessary procedures. As an employee, it is your responsibility to raise any compliance concerns, and improper billing.</p>
