            <p>Patients and their families come to CHOP to receive world-class healthcare. Providing this level of care requires that we protect the confidential information of our patients, our workforce members, and our institution.

            <p>Failure to protect confidential information can cause harm to our patients and our institution.</p>

          <p>A data breach is an incident in which patient
            information is seen or heard by an individual not
            authorized to see or hear it. Data breaches occur
            whenever the confidentiality of patient information is
            compromised. In calendar year 2014 alone, over 215
            large healthcare breaches occurred in the United
            States. Each involved the information of at least 500
            people and affected over 10 million individuals. Since
            2009, the federal government reports that more than 41
            million people were affected by large healthcare data
            breaches. This number does not include the nearly
            150,000 individuals affected by smaller breaches each
            year.</p>
          <p>Almost half of the large data breach incidents
            involved a lost or stolen portable device such as a
            laptop, USB drive, or external hard drive. In the
            majority of these cases, human error and lack of basic
            security practices were the cause of the incident.</p>

            that their information was involved in a data breach
            incident. Since 2009 when the data breach notification
            rule went into effect, CHOP has notified over 2,500
            patient families of a data breach that occurred either
            at CHOP or at one of our vendors. These incidents
            remind us of the ongoing need to practice data

          <h3>Passwords</h3>
          <p>The use of strong passwords can slow or often defeat
            the various attack methods used to compromise a
            computer's security.</p>
          <p>To make them easier to remember, users often use the
            same or similar passwords for all their applications
            and given a choice, most users select very simple and
            easy-to-remember passwords such as their birthday,
            their mother's maiden name, or the name of a relative.
            Short and simple passwords are relatively easy for
            attackers to determine via the following methods:</p>

                        "Your CHOP password must be eight characters and contain upper and lower case letters and numbers"
                        class="shadow" src="img/dpa03/password.jpg"></div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Guessing</h5>
              <p>The attacker attempts to log on using the
                user's account by repeatedly guessing likely
                words and phrases such as their children's
                names, pet's names, their city of birth, and
                local sports teams.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Dictionary Attack</h5>
              <p>The attacker uses an automated program that
                includes a text file of words or a string of
                characters. The program repeatedly tries
                different password attempts to log into the
                system until it finds the user's password.
                These attacks are often very successful when
                individuals use passwords like ‘123456' or
                common combinations like ‘password123'.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="display: block; float: left">Your CHOP
            password must be eight characters and contain upper and
            lower case letters and numbers. Ideally, create a
            unique CHOP password using a passphrase (e.g.,
            &quot;data protection is for everyone at CHOP&quot; =
            dpis4e1@CHOP) and do not use your CHOP password for any
            other personal accounts. Your CHOP password should not
            be written down or shared with anyone for any
            reason.</p>
